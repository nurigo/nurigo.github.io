<p>Well, I guess it’s quite obvious that I really enjoy working with Jekyll — with good reasons — so let me just briefly suggest some of the benefits of using a static site generator in favor of a heavy dynamic, database driven content management system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speed</strong>: Static HTML pages are small, lightweight and perform blazingly fast. You’ll notice the difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Version Control</strong>: Contents and files remain on your computer. Perform backups or keep track of changes via GIT or SVN — <em>it’s quite easy without a database.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Ruby and Liquid — <em>Jekyll’s foundation</em> — empower you to easily extend its functionality. Or just use one of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">many plugins</a> created by a striving community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security</strong>: Anything you’ll ever put on your server are static files — chances are good that <em>you’ll never need to worry</em> about security concerns anymore.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If that still doesn’t convince you to at least give it a try, I’d like to encourage you to head over to the Jekyll website and see it for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Heck, it’s that good</strong> — I even wrote all of the guides for the theme documentation with it!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
